# Badexe
This is an example of a Remote Access Trojan that is designed for education and research purposes to better help understand how these trojans work and how to build defenses against them.

Badexe is a remote access trojan designed specifically for education and research purposes. Badexe is a safer alternative to the traditional way of pulling a malware sample captured in the wild and attempting to run and disassemble it in a virtualized environment to determine how it functions. 

Many malware samples that are captured in the wild are often heavily obfuscated and stripped of any identifying information, making it difficult to determine their origins and purpose. This lack of information can make it challenging for security researchers to fully understand how a particular malware strain functions, including how it communicates with its command-and-control server and what types of commands it can execute on the infected system.

Badexe, on the other hand, provides security researchers with a rare opportunity to analyze a remote access trojan with complete access to its source code and the command-and-control server. With access to the source code, security researchers can easily identify the trojan's functionality and even modify the code to test various defense strategies.

Moreover, the command-and-control server is often the central hub that an attacker uses to control and manage the infected machines. By having access to this server, security researchers can observe and monitor the attacker's behavior and potentially gain insights into their tactics and motives.

This level of insight is incredibly valuable for developing more effective defense strategies against remote access trojans. With Badexe, security engineers can simulate real-world scenarios, test different detection and mitigation techniques, and improve their overall understanding of remote access trojans. Ultimately, the availability of source code and access to the command-and-control server makes Badexe an incredibly powerful learning tool for those looking to improve their understanding of remote access trojans.
